# HTTP_POST_with_Swift

This is a very simple iPhone app that allows a user to either take a picture with the iPhone's back camera, or select a picture from the iPhone's Photos app. Once an image has either been created or selected, the user can press "POST Image to server", which will send that image to a server using an HTTP POST request.

This is the example code for Part 2/2 of a blog post I made over at my site, wilsonnashdesign.com.
